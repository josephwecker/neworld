Personality choices / Good/Bad defined by a code of conduct
  Affects how they are trusted by certain creatures / powers

MAGIC
  Big source is character's "link" with other creatures, plants, animals, and
energies- but particularly creatures.  Link has to be developed- has to come
from their desire to share it (or coercion?)

From Samuel:
  - Different fonts for different languages that reflect somewhat the features
    of that language's phonology.
  - The tone of a communication can be indicated with colors- just like the
    "focus" system- then you get a feel for how threatening a creature is based
    on color even when you don't know the language at all.

(From a discussion a while ago)
  - For other game languages- take the human description, hash it, and then map
    the (longish) hash against a markov-chain derived phoneticly "learned"
    dialect of that language - then just pipe the result through a
    speach-to-text system (ideally one that supports far more sounds than the
    standard English ones).

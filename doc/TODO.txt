-------
(1) Create basic/static terrain w/ most/all permutations present (inc. caves)
(2) Display horizontal tiles (strict rectangular w/ walls down(?))
(3) Move center orientation in horizontal directions
(4) Move position vertically
(5) Follow terrain

(6) Rotate
(7) Neighbor based smoothing tiles
(8) Vertical tiles
(9) Basic color generation

Then two paths: Auto-terrain and Better tile rendering
	
Eventually(?)
Erosion
Real-time flow / displacement

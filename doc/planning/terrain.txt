Features:
  * Relatively endless
  * Scale very straight-forward
  * Know values JIT
  * JIT erosions
  * Boulders, rocks, etc.
  * Easily built-in caves etc.

Ideas:
  * Change parameters based on earlier noise function
    (for example, the gain, sharpness, etc.)
  * Change % that an algorithm is used based on earlier noise function
  * Plataues - clamp at different levels based on earlier noise function
  * Fault-line algorithm somewhere...

  * Stop auto-clamping-  Just record min / max.... or not even that, since the
    values are going to be transformed into "columns" anyway...


  * Perlin or simplex
  * Ridged Perlin
  * Fault-line
  * Recursive erosion (see near bottom of http://www.nullpointer.co.uk/content/?p=74 )


ThermalErosion((Simplex() * FaultLine()) + (Simplex2() * RidgedPerlin()))

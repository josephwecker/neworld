rendered-map:  (e.g.) 1024 x 768

Dimetric  advance X by: 24
          advance Y by: 12
          offset X by:   4

Isometric advance X by: 34
          advance Y by: 17
          offset X by:  17

Given: map, center-tile, center-height, and viewport width+height
Traverse to top-left-most tile.
Traverse to top as if height were not a factor
Offset Y down based on how high center-height is.  In the future fill this area
  with fuzzed tiles, or paralexing sky, etc...
Move as left as necessary to be >= than 1/2 of column width (advance-X) to the
  left of the viewport boundary.

Like reading a book.  Left to right, top to bottom.
  Render current row
    Render current column
      Offset Y temporarily by height (vs. center-height)
      Render (or have it render itself, or via(?) interface "TileRenderer"...)
        Render surface tile
	Render vertical faces (in future, only as far down as necessary - for
          now just no further than lower boundary of viewport)
      Advance X by x-advance to the right.
      Loop next column to the right unless X is past right boundary
  Back at the ranch (leftmost tile of current row)...
  Advance Y
  If Y is now below boundary, finished.
  Adjust X by offset
  Go down-left one tile
  If current X is more than X-advance to the left of boundary, advance right
    one tile.
  Loop
